My name is Carson Troutman. After, working as a teacher and a pastor for a decade, I've been learning to be a developer for the last 2 years. I'm currently in the final stages of a Data Analytics program with Code Kentucky. I've spent the past months learning python and sql, and I'm currently finishing up a project that utilizes public real estate data to evaluate the best leads for roof replacement projects.
